### "All Ones" GA :white_check_mark:
This is a very basic problem that can be solved using binary representation.
As the name suggests, the problem is simply finding a string which is comprised entirely of ones.
So for a string with a length of 5 the best solution would be, “11111”.

### "Hello World" GA String Evolve :capital_abcd:
Evolving a target string from a population of random strings.

## To-Do list :scroll::pencil2:
- [x] "All Ones" GA
- [ ] "Hello World" GA - String Evolve
- [ ] Single machine scheduling with sequence dependent setup times
