Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithm based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics. As such they represent an intelligent exploitation of a random search used to solve optimization problems. Although randomised, GAs are by no means random, instead they exploit historical information to direct the search into the region of better performance within the search space. The basic techniques of the GAs are designed to simulate processes in natural systems necessary for evolution, specially those follow the principles first laid down by Charles Darwin of "survival of the fittest.". Since in nature, competition among individuals for scanty resources results in the fittest individuals dominating over the weaker ones.

## "All Ones" GA :white_check_mark:
This is a very basic problem that can be solved using binary representation.
As the name suggests, the problem is simply finding a string which is comprised entirely of ones.
So for a string with a length of 5 the best solution would be, “11111”.

## "Hello World" GA String Evolve :capital_abcd:
Evolving a target string from a population of random strings using [Hamming Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance).

## Single machine scheduling with sequence dependent setup times :factory:
